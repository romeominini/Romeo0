<h1>MY BELIEVE'S AND MESSAGE TO BELIEVERS!</h1>
<p>
  Life is all about understanding, so many christians fail to understand humans and how humans personality is important. Humans are different and unique. No two persons are the same but understanding human personality and temperament play a major role in christiandom.
  Sometimes, leaders and believers misunderstand humans and their fellow believers which lead them to ask question about  the salvation of other brethren. This is very common in this contemporary world.
  A careful examination of the Bible characters and our LORD AND SAVOIR JESUS CHRIST gives an understanding of humans and their temperament. 

</p>
<p>
Now, it is important to know that a christian is a christian and a sinner is a sinner. if any one has not giving his or her life to christ that person is a sinner. the scripture said for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. lets look at some human characteristics, personality or temperament.

</p>
<h2>
INTROVERTS, EXTROVERTS AND AMBIVERTS
</h2>
<h3>
INTROVERSION
</h3>
<p>
Introversion is the state of being predominantly interested in one's own mental self. Introverts are typically perceived as more reserved or reflective. Some popular psychologists have characterized introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction. This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy. Few modern conceptions make this distinction. Introverts often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading, writing, or meditating. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Mistaking introversion for shyness is a common error. Introversion is a preference, while shyness stems from distress. Introverts prefer solitary to social activities, but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do.
Common introvert traits are;
•	Enjoy spending time in solitude
•	Don’t prefer to be the center of attention
•	Value close one-on-one relationships
•	Think before they speak/not as talkative
•	Need time alone to recharge and reflect
•	Prefer working in quiet, independent environments
•	Deeply focus and think about specific interests
•	Can be seen as reserved

</p>
<h3>
EXTROVERSION
</h3>
<P>
Extraversion (also spelled as extroversion) is the state of primarily obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves. Being more of an extroverted person means you thrive on the energy of the people and things around you.
Common extrovert traits
•	Have large social networks
•	Enjoy being the center of attention
•	Tend to think out loud
•	Make quick decisions 
•	Gain energy from being around other people
•	Outgoing, enthusiastic, and positive
•	Thrive in team-oriented and open work settings

</P>
<h3>
AMBIVERSION
</h3>
<p>
Ambiversion
Although many people view being introverted or extraverted as mutually exclusive, most contemporary trait theories measure levels of extraversion-introversion as part of a single, continuous dimension of personality, with some scores near one end, and others near the halfway mark. Ambiversion is falling more or less directly in the middle. An ambivert is moderately comfortable with groups and social interaction, but also relishes time alone, away from a crowd. In simpler words, an ambivert is a person whose behaviour changes according to the situation they are in. In the face of authority or in the presence of strangers, the person may be introverted. However, in the presence of family or close friends, the person may be highly energetic or extraverted.

<h3>
SANGUINE
</h3>
<P>
People with a sanguine personality type tend to be lively, optimistic, buoyant, and carefree. They love adventure and have high risk tolerance.
Sanguine people are typically poor at tolerating boredom and will seek variety and entertainment. Naturally, this trait can sometimes negatively affect their romantic and other relationships.
Because this temperament is prone to pleasure-seeking behaviors, many people with sanguine personalities are likely to struggle with addictions. Their constant cravings can lead to overeating and weight problems.
Sanguine people are very creative and can become great artists. Moreover, they are fantastic entertainers and will do well if they choose careers in the entertainment industry. Their natural abilities will also serve them well if they choose jobs related to
•	marketing,
•	travel,
•	fashion,
•	cooking,
•	or sports.

<h3>
PHLEGMATIC

<P>
Someone with a phlegmatic personality is usually a people person.
They seek interpersonal harmony and close relationships, which makes phlegmatic people loyal spouses and loving parents. They make it a point to preserve their relationships with old friends, distant family members, and neighbors.
People with phlegmatic temperaments tend to avoid conflict and always try to mediate between others to restore peace and harmony.
They are very much into charity and helping others. Ideal careers for phlegmatic personality types should be related to

</P>
<h3>

</h3>
<P>
Someone with a pure choleric temperament is usually a goal-oriented person.
Choleric people are very savvy, analytical, and logical. Extremely practical and straightforward, they aren’t necessarily good companions or particularly friendly.
They dislike small talks and enjoy deep and meaningful conversations. They would rather be alone than in the company of shallow, superficial people.

</P>
<h3>
MELANCHOLIC
</h3>
<P>
People with melancholic personalities love traditions. Women cook for men; men open doors for women.
They love their families and friends and, unlike sanguine people, they do not look for novelty and adventure. Even more so, they avoid it as much as they can.
Someone with a melancholic temperament is unlikely to marry a foreigner or leave their homeland for another country.
Melancholic people are very social and seek to contribute to the community. Being extremely thorough and accurate, they are fantastic managers with good personalities. Perfect careers for melancholic personality type should be in:
•	management;
•	accounting;
•	social work;
•	or administration.

</P>
<P>
There is a popular saying that wisdom is the application of knowlegde. Now lets look at some Bible characters and then ask ourselves some questions.

</P>
<h2>
ELIJAH
</h2>
<P>

People have this idea that the prophet Elijah was a strong powerhouse. This is not completely accurate. We don’t know much about Elijah, but we do know he, “was a man subject to like passions as we are” (King James Version, James 5: 17).  Yes; he performed the miracle of the barrel of meal and a cruse of oil and resurrected the widow’s son (1 Kings 17: 7-24). Yes; he parted the Jordan (1 Kings 2:8). And most amazingly, he was caught up to heaven in a whirlwind (1 Kings 2:11).  Even still, the Bible makes it clear to note Elijah’s humanity. At times, Elijah was afraid (1 Kings 19:3). He had doubts and was conflicted (1 Kings 19:14). Elijah even struggled with suicide (1 Kings 19:4).  Simply put, he was a human being just like you.

</P>
<P>
We all have a purpose, and God gives us assignments to complete our purpose. Elijah was tasked to, “turn the heart of the fathers to their children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (King James Version, Malachi 4:6). One way Elijah did this is by challenging the prophets of Baal. In 1 Kings 18:38, Elijah proves that the God of Abraham is the one true God when he prayed for fire from heaven to burn the sacrifice on the wet altar (something the prophets of Baal could not accomplish). This miracle made the people believe that, “The Lord, He is the God” (King James Version, 1 Kings 19:39). Elijah then killed all the prophets of Baal. It seemed as if Elijah had won. But Jezebel didn’t see it that way. She condemned him to death (1 Kings 19:2). His assignment didn’t go according to his plan, so he fell into depression and ran into the wilderness to escape persecution. Even though Elijah worked supernatural miracles, he was still subject to human emotions. Like many of us, he had a “wilderness experience”. Here are five key things we can learn from Elijah’s humanizing wilderness experience.

</P>
<P>
Housed within our soul is our temperament. The ancient Greeks characterized four types of temperament: sanguine, choleric, melancholy and phlegmatic. The sanguine is lively and optimistic. People with choleric temperament are often logical. Those with melancholic temperament are traditional and like to be right. And, people with phlegmatic temperament like to be around people and desire to have loving and close relationships. Elijah’s temperament can be best described as melancholy.  Melancholies want to be in control. They like to win. They are usually the most depressed out of the four temperaments. Life is beyond the control of man. Losing control of circumstances is what might cause melancholies to be depressed.
After Elijah’s victory over the prophets of Baal, he was forced to run for his life. His victory was snatched away from him, and he seemingly went from winning to losing. Elijah didn’t like to lose. Melancholies are also perfectionist. Elijah lost focus. The victory was never his in the first place. We have to remember that God is in control. Yielding our expectations over to God will make it more difficult to be depressed. Remember, what you think is a failure, God might not see as a failure. Trust that God has your best interest.

</P>
<h2>
ABRAHAM
</h2>
<P>
A good Bible illustration of the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a phlegmatic is easy-going, good-natured Abraham. This great patriarch was dominated most of his life by fear. In fact, twice in his life he was so selfishly fearful that he denied his wife and tried to palm her off as his sister. She was such a beautiful woman that he thought Pharoah and later Abimelech would kill him to marry her. This cowardly man was later transformed so much by the gift of faith it was said of him: ‘Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness’”.

</P>
<h2>
THOMAS
</h2>
<P>
“The Apostle Thomas is a good New Testament example of what God can do with a Spirit-filled melancholy temperament. He is known as the doubting disciple because of his famous statement, ‘Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into his side, I will not believe’ (John 20:25) That is blatant unbelief induced by Thomas’ doubts. Blatant because the words were spoken in spite of the Lord’s oft-repeated promise to rise again and the ten disciples’ assurance ‘that we have seen the Lord’. Humanly such a man was doomed to failure but such was not the case with Thomas.”

</P>
<h2>
PETER
</h2>
<P>
“The apostle Peter is a good example of a Spirit-filled sanguine. After the day of Pentecost, Peter used his lips to preach Jesus Christ in power. There was an apparent consistency and control in Peter’s life from that point on, and absolutely no self-seeking tendencies. He was still a leader, but his conduct in Acts 4 shows a Spirit-dominated restraint foreign to his nature. His life was used greatly to glorify Christ because he was spirit-filled.”

</P>
<h2>
PAUL
</h2>
<P>
“The Apostle Paul is probably the best illustration of a Spirit-filled choleric to be found in the Bible. We first see him in Acts 8 ‘consenting’ to the murder of the first Christian martyr, Stephen. In chapter 9 we find him ‘….breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciple of the Lord’. If ever there was a description of a raw choleric, this is it. Yet Bible students are thrilled to find this man so dynamically transformed that the very study of his post-conversion conduct has been used by God to lead many to acknowledge the supernatural power of Jesus Christ as the only explanation of his behaviour.”

</P>
<h2>
MY STAND
</h2>
<P>
Some christains believe that one must be gentle, quiet , not talking,  sober  always and separated from others before he or she will be called a christian. Christain aought to stand and speak out in time of temptation just like Paul who is out spoken and knowledgable in almost all field of life
. Once upon a time before Nigeria got her independence, we were made to understand that during the time of agitation for freedom the then christain said no to it. Some christain opposed the fight for freedom and when the freedom was achieved everyone enjoyed it together even the christain that were saying no to it. I satnd therefor to say that as a christain try to make sure you don't fall into sin, keep the commandments of GOD and do that which is right let no man dispise or judge you.
The characteristics of a good leader is summarized in the life of our Savior Jesus Christ

<h2>
OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD
</h2>
<h3>Shepherd, Lamb and Lion
</h3>
<P>
Revelation 4-7 gives us two visions of heaven. In one vision, Jesus is both a Lion and a Lamb (Revelation 5:6-7). In the other vision, he is the Lamb and the Shepherd (Revelation 7:17). The visions show us that Jesus gets us all the way home to heaven by being our Lion, Lamb, and Shepherd.

</P>

<P>
The Lion of the Tribe of Judah is a reference to Jesus as the Messiah. He is the conqueror and the one who has authority. Jesus puts down enemies and defends his people. He has power. This Lion is on our side; he has fought our battle against sin, evil, and death. He gives us hope.

</P>
<P>
As the Lamb who was slain, Jesus cleanses us. He died our death in our place as the sacrificial lamb. Before the Lamb we acknowledge our sin, turn to him in repentance and faith, trust in his forgiveness, and receive his righteousness. His blood is not a stain to be removed; it is a sin-removing power.

</P>
<P>
As the Shepherd, Jesus leads and guides us to the throne of God. He brings us into the temple of God and to the shelter of God’s presence, where there is no more hunger or thirst (because we are forever being satisfied by the living water), and no more tears or sorrow (because we are forever experiencing the joy of the Lord). He leads us home.

</P>
<P>
“He will feed his flock like a shepherd.
He will carry the lambs in his arms,
holding them close to his heart.
He will gently lead the mother sheep with their young.”  Isaiah 40:11

</P>
<P>
We’ve all heard that Jesus is the good Shepherd.  And we can certainly identify with being a sheep.  The times when we are not in control of our circumstances, and we feel less than powerful, we know we need someone bigger than ourselves to lend us a hand.  In a matter of seconds, an event can change our lives forever:  an auto accident, a diagnosis, a death.  In those times, we instinctively turn to God.
Jesus is our shepherd, but interestingly, he is also called a lamb.  Not even a grown sheep, just a defenseless lamb. Jesus put aside his God-power to become a defenseless sacrificial lamb.  He understands how we feel when things have gone all wrong.
“Stop weeping!  Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David’s throne, has won the victory.  Then I saw a Lamb that looked like it had been slaughtered, but it was now standing before the throne… and they sang a new song, ‘You are worthy…for you were slaughtered and your blood has ransomed people for God’”  Revelation 5:5,6,9

</P>
<P>
He is the lamb.  He is the shepherd.  He is the lion.  He is quiet.  He roars.  He is gentle.  He is powerful.  He is high enough, deep enough, wide enough, strong enough, caring enough, gentle enough to care for all people in all circumstances. He was, he is, he always will be enough for us.  He is enough to be the Lord of the football player, the soldier, the factory worker, the executive, the artist, the mother, the father, the child.  He is the infinite God in flesh and bones.  The great paradox.

</P>
<P>
“He (Jesus) existed in the beginning with God.
God created everything through him,
and nothing was created except through him.”  John 1:2-3
“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”  Jesus in Revelation 22:13

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
“Yes, the Sovereign Lord is coming in power.
He will rule with a powerful arm.
See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.
He will feed his flock like a shepherd.
He will carry the lambs in his arms,
holding them close to his heart.
He will gently lead the mother sheep with their young.
Who else has held the oceans in his hand?
Who has measured off the heavens with his fingers?
Who else knows the weight of the earth
