<h1>THE MEDICAL LABORATORY SCIENTIST AND THE MEDICAL DOCTOR!</h1>
<p>
The health of the citizems should be the primary concern of the health team. Health workers are meant to work in harmony to provide quality service. Health sector is sector that that comprises of different profession. And everyone is a master in  his or her field.
The sector clearly defines true division of Labour as every profession is unique and very important.

<h2>
THE HEALTH SECTOR IN NIGERIA
</h2>
<p>
In Nigeria, several challenges have been reported within the health sector, especially in training, funding, employment, and deployment of the health workforce. We aimed to review recent health workforce crises in the Nigerian health sector to identify key underlying causes and provide recommendations toward preventing and/or managing potential future crises in Nigeria
The Nigerian health system is relatively weak, and there is yet a coordinated response across the country. A number of health workforce crises have been reported in recent times due to several months’ salaries owed, poor welfare, lack of appropriate health facilities and emerging factions among health workers. Poor administration and response across different levels of government have played contributory roles to further internal crises among health workers, with different factions engaged in protracted supremacy challenge. These crises have consequently prevented optimal healthcare delivery to the Nigerian population.

</p>   
<p>
An encompassing stakeholders’ forum in the Nigerian health sector remain essential. The national health system needs a solid administrative policy foundation that allows coordination of priorities and partnerships in the health workforce and among various stakeholders. The health workforce—all persons involved in activities primarily devoted to enhancing health—is an essential block of any functioning health system in any country, in the absence of which clinical and public health services cannot be delivered to the population . Health governance is the administrative umbrella of the health system primarily concerned with policymaker- or government-led steering and rule-making functions targeted at achieving national health policy objectives for effective delivery of health services and attainment of universal health coverage . Experts have actually shown direct links between efficient health system governance and promising health workers outputs, which ultimately have positive effects on overall health outcomes . However, poor administration and continued underinvestment in health, even with the spread of HIV/AIDS, re-emerging diseases and persistent violent conflicts, have contributed greatly to the fragile health systems in many African states . While there have been calls for concerted efforts—social, economic, environmental and multisectoral—toward health system strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) , human resources’ crises in the health sector have continued to be a major challenge . The governments of many African countries have reported challenges in training, funding, employment, capacity building and efficient deployment of the health workforce . Consequently, the continent has continued to experience a rapidly progressive health workforce migration to high-income settings in search of better opportunities.
Crises within the health workforce have been reported as perhaps the biggest constraint towards global health system development and sustenance, particularly in Africa . According to the 2006 World Health Report, 57 countries were in severe health workforce crises, with 37 of these in sSA—a region with only 3% of global health workforce, despite contributing about a quarter to the global disease burden . Nigeria, the most populous African country, possibly contributes even more to these crises in the region. Increasing annual rates of population growth, as observed in Nigeria, has been adjudged a major factor in countries with severe health workforce crises . Nigeria obviously requires significant increase in the number of additional health workers to achieve desired population coverage. However, beyond the shortfall in health workforce, the Nigerian health sector has particularly experienced a number of other lingering crises in recent times. There are growing concerns locally and internationally over these issues, with this linked to the overall poor states of health governance in the country

THE POLITICIAN AND HEALTH OF THE CITIZENS
</h2>
<p>
Politicians take advantage of of every situation the country finds its self not having the interest of the people they are leading at heart. Any disease outbreak is a time loot money from perpective of a politician. Increase the index increase the figure so as to make more money. from the days of lasser fever, measles, HIV AIDS,ebola to corona virus there has never been accurate indeces or figures.

The dominant political ideology in a country determines the extent to which it 
expands the Welfare State with the basic principle of the Welfare State being the 
promotion of a more even distribution of the basic necessities of life. Most welfarists 
are agreed that the basic necessities of life would include basic housing, safe drinking 
water, nutritious food, basic education and access to health services.

Let communities, localities and states enforce their own laws, bye-laws and 
regulations to promote orderliness and risk-reduction. The health sector can only 
remain a strong advocate creating awareness and providing health education but it has 
no means of being on the roads to control drunken drivers, rickety no-brake vehicles 
and reckless “Okada” riders. 
The political economy and distribution of wealth has obvious implications for health 
and health status. The poor are more likely to be sick and when sick, least likely to 
access health services promptly. The cost of illness is not just the cost of treatment, 
but includes the cost of treatment seeking activities such as transportation to the 
hospital and the cost of opportunities foregone. Ill-health is therefore a major 
pauperizing factor. 
Increasing poverty levels on the other hand exposes people to increasing levels of 
health risks and disease, thereby resulting in an increasing number of sick people. 
Lack of personal resources among the poor also means they would only seek 
treatment when conditions have become catastrophic. Seeking treatment late is 
calling unfairly on health workers. This often creates desperation on everybody’s 
part. On the part of patient’s relatives, the health worker is expected to perform 
miracles and on the part of the health worker, a fear of imminent failur

<h2> THE HIDDEN PROFESSION THAT SAVES LIFE
</h2>
<P>
A medical laboratory scientist (MLS), also traditionally referred to as a clinical laboratory scientist (CLS), or medical technologist (MT), is a healthcare professional who performs chemical, hematological, immunologic, histopathological, cytopathological, microscopic, and bacteriological diagnostic analyses on body fluids such as blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and synovial fluid, as well as other specimens. Medical laboratory scientists work in clinical laboratories at hospitals, reference labs, biotechnology labs and non-clinical industrial labs. Those that work in non clinical industrial labs are often referred to as biomedical laboratory technologist (BLT) in parts of the world. Medical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests – from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars.

Medical Laboratory Scientists analyze human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods. Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician. 
Medical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, "STAT" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results. 
A typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), electrolyte panel, liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), urinalysis, coagulation profile, lipid profile, blood type, semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine cultures. In some facilities that have few phlebotomists, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training. 
Because medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter-relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings.

In Nigeria, Medical Laboratory Science is a high skilled profession charged by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria. The initial qualification awarded graduates of the programme, like some other medical programmes, was Associate of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology/Science (AIMLT/AIMLS) The Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria, which was established by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, regulates the practice of Medical Laboratory Science in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the Medical Laboratory Science programme is Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLS), regulated by National Universities Commission (NUC) and by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN). Students at their first year (100 level) are trained under the Faculty of Science in Basic Sciences and Faculty of Arts, Management and Social science in General studies and Entrepreneurship. At the 200 level, students are taught basic medical sciences and are introduced to Medical Laboratory Science. The third year of the programme marks the beginning of the professional training as students are engaged in the classroom for lectures as well as in the Hospital laboratory for the professional or practical training. At the fourth year students are taught the basics in all the special areas of Medical Laboratory Science. At the end of 400 level programme, successful students are presented for the First professional examination, to be moderated by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria At the fifth year, students break into 4 core or specialized areas of Medical Laboratory Science, namely: medical microbiology/parasitology, chemical pathology/immunology, haematology/blood transfusion science and histopathology/cytopathology. At the end of the fifth year, suitable students are presented for final professional examination by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria.
